# 🚀 Hintify – Smart Hint Generator for Coding Practice

**Hintify** is a Chrome extension designed for college students and self-learners who practice coding on platforms like **LeetCode, CodeChef, HackerRank**, and more.

Instead of directly providing full solutions, Hintify generates **3 progressive hints** tailored to the problem you're solving — helping you think critically, strengthen your logic, and improve your coding ability.
If you still need help, you can optionally get assistance using **AI (ChatGPT)**.

## 🌟 Features

* 🔍 **Automatic Problem Detection**
  Hintify detects the coding problem you're currently viewing (e.g., “Two Sum” on LeetCode).

* 💡 **Three-Level Hint System**
  Receive **3 hints** — starting broad and becoming more guided — without revealing the final code.

* 🤖 **AI Assistance (Optional)**
  If the hints aren’t enough, you can ask AI (ChatGPT) for further help.

* 🎯 **Boost Problem-Solving Skills**
  Designed to promote thinking and discourage directly copying solutions.

* 🌐 **Supports Popular Coding Platforms**
  ✔️ LeetCode
  ✔️ CodeChef
  ✔️ HackerRank
  ✔️ (More platforms coming soon...)
